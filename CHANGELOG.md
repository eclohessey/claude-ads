# Changelog

All notable changes to claude-ads are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.1.0] - 2026-09-11

### Added
- **`seo` skill** — organic search ranking and AI-answer visibility audit, sharing
  the `ads` 3-layer architecture. 9 sub-skills, 4 parallel subagents, 10 reference
  files, 110 weighted checks.
- **Dual scoring**: the same checks are weighted twice, producing a Google Search
  Score and an AI Search Score. They diverge, and the divergence determines which
  remediation plan to run first.
- **Check families**: technical and indexing (TE01-TE30), content quality and
  E-E-A-T (CO01-CO25), AI search readiness (AE01-AE25), off-site authority
  (AU01-AU15), structured data (SD01-SD15).
- **Sub-skills**: `/seo audit`, `/seo technical`, `/seo content`, `/seo aeo`,
  `/seo schema`, `/seo authority`, `/seo keywords`, `/seo competitor`, `/seo local`.
- **Subagents**: `audit-seo-technical`, `audit-seo-content`, `audit-seo-aeo`,
  `audit-seo-authority`, spawned in parallel during `/seo audit`.
- **`scripts/seo_crawl.py`** — crawls a site and extracts on-page SEO plus
  AI-extractability signals (answer-first structure, question-shaped headings,
  self-contained sections, tables, JSON-LD types, JS-dependency detection).
  Uses the stdlib HTML parser; only `requests` is required.
- **`scripts/check_ai_crawlers.py`** — parses robots.txt with correct
  user-agent-group and longest-match precedence, and reports access per crawler.
  Separates training crawlers (`GPTBot`, `ClaudeBot`, `Google-Extended`) from
  answer crawlers (`OAI-SearchBot`, `ChatGPT-User`, `Claude-SearchBot`,
  `PerplexityBot`) — only the latter affect live AI citation.
- **`scripts/ai_visibility.py`** — stdlib-only prompt-set generator and result
  ledger for measuring brand visibility across AI answer engines, reporting
  visibility rate, citation rate, and share of voice against competitors.

### Changed
- Install and uninstall scripts (bash + PowerShell) now handle both skill trees;
  SEO scripts install under `~/.claude/skills/seo/scripts/`.
- `CLAUDE.md` and `README.md` document both skills and the SEO quality gates.

### Notes
- The `seo` skill never fabricates traffic, ranking, search volume, backlink, or
  Domain Authority figures. Unmeasurable checks are reported in a "Not Evaluated"
  table rather than scored as passes.
- AI visibility is sampled via a fixed prompt set, not measured. There is no rank
  API for AI answers; reports track direction over time, never a rank.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- **Apple Search Ads sub-skill** (`/ads apple`): 35 checks across campaign structure (BOFU/MOFU/Search Match), bid health (CPT vs install rate, CPA Goals), Creative Sets (Custom Product Pages), MMP attribution (AppsFlyer/Adjust/SKAdNetwork), budget pacing, TAP placement coverage (Today/Search/Product Pages), and goal CPA benchmarks by app category and country tier
- **Context Intake** step in orchestrator: Claude now asks for industry, monthly ad spend, primary goal, and active platforms before any audit — ensures benchmarks and recommendations match the user's actual situation instead of defaulting to generic industry averages
- **Google Ads MCP reference** in README: links to [google-ads-mcp](https://github.com/googleads/google-ads-mcp) for users who want live API-connected audits
- **FAQ section** in README: addresses top community questions (API login, benchmark accuracy, manual ad posting, budget context, platform support)
- **"How It Analyzes Your Ads"** section in README: clearly explains manual data input model and data export workflow

### Fixed
- `install.ps1`: PowerShell 5.1 crash on git clone — git progress writes to stderr which PS 5.1 treated as a terminating error under `$ErrorActionPreference = "Stop"`. Fixed by temporarily setting `Continue` around clone call and using `2>&1 | Out-Null`
- `uninstall.ps1`: Parse failure on non-UTF-8-BOM systems — Unicode `→` and `✓` characters in double-quoted strings caused `TerminatorExpectedAtEndOfString`. Replaced with ASCII equivalents
- `ads-google/SKILL.md`: Negative keyword guidance now enforces Exact Match `[kw]` and Phrase Match `"kw"` types by default — never Broad Match negatives. Negatives must be sourced from Search Terms Report data and grouped into themed Shared Lists. Includes over-blocking review step
- `ads/SKILL.md`: Removed unsupported `allowed-tools` frontmatter field per Anthropic skill spec
- `ads/SKILL.md`: Added `apple` to `argument-hint` subcommand list
- Install scripts: Updated sub-skill count from 12 → 13 to reflect new ads-apple addition

## [1.1.1] - 2026-02-11

### Fixed
- M-CR2 vs M37 frequency threshold ambiguity: clarified M-CR2 is ad set level (<3.0) and M37 is campaign level (<4.0)
- Ecommerce template PMax image count aligned to G31 audit check (15 → 20 images per asset group)
- Real estate template budget percentages widened to bracket 100% (was 90-105%, now 80-110%)
- Info products template TikTok allocation note: added minimum $50/day campaign budget caveat
- Duplicate step numbering in ads-tiktok (two step 7s) and ads-creative (two step 6s)

### Added
- `argument-hint` field on orchestrator skill for CLI subcommand hints

## [1.1.0] - 2026-02-11

### Fixed
- Audit check count corrected from 186 to 190 (actual total: Google 74 + Meta 46 + LinkedIn 25 + TikTok 25 + Microsoft 20)
- TikTok budget sufficiency threshold aligned to authoritative checklist (Pass ≥50x CPA, Warning 20-49x, Fail <20x)
- Benchmarks typo: Local Services CPC `$7.85-$15-$30` → `$7.85-$15.00`
- Call Campaigns context note: clarified creation vs serving deadlines (Feb 2026 / Feb 2027)
- Flexible Ads context note: corrected launch date from 2025 to 2024
- Scoring system weighting rationale: corrected "20-25%" to "25-30%" to match actual platform weights
- G59 mobile speed: LCP now measured on mobile viewport (375x812) instead of desktop
- G61 schema check: validates Product/FAQ/Service types per audit reference (not any schema)
- Removed unused beautifulsoup4 and lxml from requirements.txt

### Added
- `uninstall.ps1` for Windows parity (Unix already had `uninstall.sh`)
- `.gitattributes` to fix GitHub language detection (Markdown, not PowerShell)
- Research context notes in google-audit.md (ECPC deprecation, Call Campaigns sunset, Power Pack, AI Max)
- Research context notes in meta-audit.md (detailed targeting removal, Flexible Ads, Financial Products SAC)
- Research context notes in linkedin-audit.md (Connected TV, BrandLink, Live Event Ads, Accelerate campaigns)
- Weighting rationale section in scoring-system.md explaining grading band design
- Scoring system reference added to ads-tiktok and ads-creative process steps
- Missing `.gitignore` patterns for creative, landing, budget, and competitor reports

### Changed
- Removed non-spec `color` field from all 6 agent frontmatter files
- Agent frontmatter now uses only official Claude Code spec fields (name, description, model, maxTurns, tools)
